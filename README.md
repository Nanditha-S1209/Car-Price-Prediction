# Car-Price-Prediction

 This project is a comprehensive machine learning-based car price prediction system implemented in Python. It focuses on predicting used car prices based on various features such as brand, mileage, engine capacity, and more. The project involves several key stages, including preprocessing the data to ensure data quality, identifying important input data for the prediction model, handling null values and duplicates, converting categorical columns to numerical values, replacing categorical values with numerical values, and cleaning and processing the dataset for machine learning model training. Additionally, it involves the process of creating an input dataset and feeding random values to the model for prediction, extracting brand names, and selecting input data for prediction. The input details required for the model include engine capacity, maximum power, and the number of seats, which need to be collected from the user before passing it to the model. Furthermore, categorical columns such as brand, seller type, and transmission type need to be converted into numerical values before passing the input data to the model for prediction.
